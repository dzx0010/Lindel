 Model introduction:
 In recent years, CRISPR/Cas9 has become a very popular and powerful tool for genome editing. This paper systematically profiled ~1.6 million independent mutational events resulting from CRISPR/Cas9 mediated cleavage and NHEJ mediate DSB repair of 6872 synthetic target sequences, introduced in to a human cell line via lentiviral infection, then developed a model called Lindel was designed to predict the distribution of mutational outcomes using local sequence context.
  Scripts and software are available from GitHub repository: https://github.com/shendurelab/Lindel . Lindel is written in Python3, and It mainly has model scripts with .pkl format and python scripts.
How to run?
1.  Set up running environment and install software:
(1) Modify shebang line of setup.py to make it run correctly
(2) $Python3 setup.py build    to build environment 
(3) $python3 setup.py install  to install software needed
(4) $python3 setup.py - - help  can help you run  
2.  Predict the mutational outcomes
$ python3 Lindel_prediction.py [argument1 argument2]
Argument 1 is local sequence context which has PAM region (NGG) at 34~36bp. SgRNA should be from 14 to 33 bp of sequence.
Argument 2 is output filename.
For example:
One of my project is knocking out MC4R gene which is associated with dominantly inherited obesity using CRISPR/Cas9 to get fast growth channel catfish. SgRNA is designed using CRISPRscan tools at MC4R exon1: CCGCCTGCCACACGGGGCCGTTCCCCGGTAAGGCGGCGATGCGTTTCATGTGAA
I used Lindel to predict the mutational outcomes to check if the SgRNA is a efficient one.
$ python3 Lindel_prediction.py CCGCCTGCCACACGGGGCCGTTCCCCGGTAAGGCGGCGATGCGTTTCATGTGAAGCCGCGCCAAGAGGAACATGTGCACGTAAAGCGAGGCCA  output
It will output a file named output_fs_0.818.txt

Evaluation:
Goodness:
1.  There are several small scripts instead of a larger one in Lindel, that make it easier to modify and correct
2.  These scripts are useful for gene editing researchers and quite simple to run
 Weakness:
1.  There is almost empty in README.md. No instructions and no examples are provided, that make it really different for others to use this script.
2.  I can’t use Setup.py to install all packages because default install path problems
3.  There is no argparse and this scripts can’t deal with multiple sequence at one.

Modification and improvements:
1.  README.md: I added how to run install the packages (using pip install)  and how to run this scripts in README.md, and provided an example.
2.  Modified the scripts execution time:
Before modifying:
  real    0m0.951s
  user    0m0.458s
   sys     0m0.423s
After modifying:
    real    0m0.855s
    user    0m0.459s
sys     0m0.369s
3.  Added some comments and improved the output filename
